Hello ðŸ˜Š I'm Ray. I am a software engineer with a penchant for learning new things and writing code. 

Outside of tech, you'll find me recreating recipes Ã  la the Bon AppÃ©tit test kitchen, noodling on my acoustic guitar, and supporting the Los Angeles ~~Lakers~~ Clippers.

## What is Pythons and Penguins?
Pythons and Penguins is a blog to share everything that I've been learning about systems, software engineering, computer science fundamentals, and tech culture. 

I believe that teaching is the one of the best ways to reinforce my own knowledge, and I hope that this blog provides value for anyone who is starting out or interested in DevOps.

Here's to building cool things--happy coding!
